- Timesheet improvements
    - Colours for standards and WR diffs
    - More track info (cup, code, num)
    - Overall sheet statistics, total, mean, histograms, count tables?
- Updater improvements
    - More descriptive success message (you improved by 0.000 if pb)
    - Add track links in recent table
- Specific track pages
    - Delete times from DB
