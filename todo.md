# TODO
Moved out of the readme.

## Main TODO
- Handle negative diffs (e.g. edge case where user has a time lower than given wr)
- Timesheet improvements
    - More track info (cup / image, code)
    - Improve charts (palettes, styling options, etc)
    - Think of a better overall metric
- Updater improvements
    - More descriptive success message (you improved by 0.000 if pb)
- Specific track pages
    - Toggle cc and items on a track page
    - Cool visualisations, show ranks on improvements graph
    - Times datatable with pages
    - Insert times with autofilled fields, copying mostly from update page
    - Delete times from DB
- Add track links to tables, add page for convenient track selection
    - Track and cup images
- Add like the entire track picker page lmao
- Home page
    - Glossary
    - Better links

## Future considerations
- Track picker with smart suggestions
- Get WR video and other info when looking at specific track pages
- Interactive visualisations (like tooltips on hover)
- Support for NITA times, WRs
- File upload support for timesheets as CSVs
- Colourblind support would be cool (toggle cividis for standards?)
- Users and auth, going public, github pages or similar
