# TODO
Moved out of the readme.

## Main TODO
- Handle negative diffs (e.g. edge case where user has a time lower than given wr)
- Timesheet improvements
    - More track info (cup / image, code)
    - Add track links
    - Histograms, counts?
- Updater improvements
    - More descriptive success message (you improved by 0.000 if pb)
    - Add track links in recent table
- Specific track pages
    - Toggle cc and items on a track page
    - Cool visualisations
    - Times datatable
    - Insert times with autofilled fields, copying mostly from update page
    - Delete times from DB
- Home page overhaul
    - Glossary maybe
- Track and cup images
- Add like the entire track picker page lmao

## Future considerations
- Track picker with smart suggestions
- Get WR video and other info when looking at specific track pages
- Interactive visualisations (like tooltips on hover)
- Support for NITA times, WRs
- File upload support for timesheets as CSVs
- Colourblind support would be cool (toggle cividis for standards?)
- Users and auth, going public, github pages or similar
