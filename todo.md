- Style the components with the bootstrap grid properly, you bot (NO)
- Clean up code in general, improve doco, etc.

## Future considerations
- Redo TrackTime class(es), probably better to just use floats rather than timedeltas
- Get WR video and other info when looking at specific track pages
- File upload support for timesheets as CSVs
- Colourblind support would be cool (toggle cividis for standards?)
- Users and auth, going public, github pages or similar
