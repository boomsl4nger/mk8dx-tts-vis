# TODO
Moved out of the readme.

## Main TODO
- Support for track name abbreviations (e.g., MKS = Mario Kart Stadium)
- Support for 200cc times
- Timesheet improvements
    - Colours for standards and WR diffs
    - Sorting for numeric columns (and maybe others)
    - Better styling (left vs right align)
    - More track info (image, cup and image)
    - Search bar?
    - Toggle to remove columns (num columns, standards)
- Updater improvements
    - More descriptive success message (you improved by 0.000 if pb)
    - More column in recent table, add track links
    - Delete recent time from table
- Specific track pages
    - Delete times from DB
- Home page overhaul
    - Glossary maybe

## Future considerations
- Track picker for smart suggestions
- Get WR video and other info when looking at specific track pages
- Interactive visualisations (like tooltips on hover)
- Support for NITA times, WRs
- File upload support for timesheets as CSVs
- Users and auth, going public
