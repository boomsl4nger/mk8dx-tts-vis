- Style the components with the bootstrap grid properly, you bot (NO)
- Style the charts better, palettes and stuff (mmm reading)
- Add a dummy times sheet for messing around with, rand diff wr + 1-12s
- Timesheet improvements
    - Add codes to table
    - Think of a better overall metric
- Specific track pages
    - Add row from timesheet for convenience
    - Show ranks on graph
- Add like the entire track picker page lmao
- Home page
    - Glossary
    - Better links

## Future considerations
- Support for NITA times, WRs
- Get WR video and other info when looking at specific track pages
- Track picker with smart suggestions
- File upload support for timesheets as CSVs
- Colourblind support would be cool (toggle cividis for standards?)
- Users and auth, going public, github pages or similar
