# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Time Trials Visualiser

Personal project combining my hobby with some data visualisation and analysis. Ideally becomes a web app with all the features I want to implement.

Goals:
- Set-up a nice way to read and calculate TT time format
- Collectively display the current times for each track
- Categorise the tracks into Standards rankings
- Get and compare to the current world records (WRs)
- Visualisations based on the rank counts and WR differences
- Sorting based on criteria like WR diffs
- Normalised-time-based rankings for alternative comparisons
- Statistics for WR diffs, etc.
- Web app integration of these main features + database usage rather than CSVs

Other misc goals:
- Practice suggestions based on select criteria (such as choosing from worst 10 times)
- Kart build stats visualiser
- Support for different categories like 200 and NITA

TODO:
- Priority: back-end stuff like parsing and combining data, simple visualisations
- Flask for web app
- Front-end libraries for things like data tables, interactive graphs, templates, navigating pages, etc.
- SQLite for database, design schemas, libraries for interaction with web app
- Update tracking + visualisations
