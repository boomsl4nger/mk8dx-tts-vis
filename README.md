# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Time Trials Visualiser

Personal project combining my hobby with some data visualisation and analysis. 
Ideally becomes a web app with all the features I want to implement. 
Back-end basics are mostly done so now want to make a web-app for a decent UI to interact with.

TODO:
- [x] Back-end stuff like parsing and combining data, simple visualisations
- Support for name abbrevs
- Set-up Flask for a basic web app
- SQLite for database, design schemas, libraries for interaction with web app
- Front-end libraries for things like data tables, interactive graphs, templates, navigating pages, etc.
- Update tracking + visualisations

Future considerations:
- Practice suggestions based on select criteria (such as choosing from worst 10 times)
- Kart build stats visualiser (maybe)
- Support for different categories like 200 and NITA
